This is a Puzzle Platformer game I created using C# in the Unity Engine. I made this game for a game jam with the theme being "2-Dimensions" with that I decided  to create a very fun brain picking 2D puzzle game where the player has to switch between different worlds in order to solve obstacles and progress to the goal!
